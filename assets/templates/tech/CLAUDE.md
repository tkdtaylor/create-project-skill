## Project structure

```
src/          ← code outputs (what you write)
artifacts/    ← non-code outputs (diagrams, schemas, exports)
docs/         ← documentation inputs (what guides your work)
  architecture/   system design, ADRs, tech stack
  plans/          roadmap, sprints
  tasks/          active, backlog, completed task files
    test-specs/   TDD specs — always written before implementation
```

The key distinction: `docs/` is the input side (read before you act), `src/` is the output side (what gets produced).

## Tech stack

{{TECH_STACK}}

## Commands

```bash
# TODO: fill in — how to run tests
# TODO: fill in — how to build / compile
# TODO: fill in — how to start dev server / run the app
# TODO: fill in — how to lint / format
```

## Conventions

- Task files are named `NNN-short-name.md` (zero-padded, sequential across all task states)
- Every task has a paired test spec; no implementation starts without one
- Tasks follow Unix philosophy — one task, one responsibility; break things smaller when in doubt
- ADRs live in `docs/architecture/decisions/` — add one whenever a significant design decision is made

## Working in this project

1. Start each session by reading the relevant task file and its test spec
2. Check `docs/architecture/overview.md` for system context
3. Write the test spec before any implementation code
4. Move tasks to `completed/` and update `coverage-tracker.md` when done
5. **Commit and push immediately after each milestone** — never start the next task without committing the current one first

## Commit rules

**You must commit and push after every milestone.** Do not batch multiple tasks into one commit. Do not continue to the next task until the current one is committed and pushed.

| Milestone | What to stage | Message |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| ADR written | `docs/architecture/decisions/NNN-*.md` | `docs: add ADR NNN — <decision title>` |
| Test spec written | `docs/tasks/test-specs/NNN-*-test-spec.md`, updated `coverage-tracker.md` | `test: add spec for task NNN — <name>` |
| Task completed | `src/` changes, moved task file, updated `coverage-tracker.md` | `feat: complete task NNN — <name>` |

After each milestone:
```bash
git add <relevant files>
git commit -m "<message>"
git push
```

## Plan mode

When you exit plan mode, a hook automatically restructures the plan:
- Each step becomes a task file in `docs/tasks/backlog/`
- Test spec stubs are created for each task
- The plan is replaced with a lightweight skeleton to save context tokens
- The full plan is backed up to `docs/plans/`

Use the **task-executor** agent to work through tasks one at a time. Each agent call is ephemeral — it reads the task file, does the work, commits, and reports back without bloating the main conversation.

```
use task-executor — task: docs/tasks/backlog/NNN-name.md, spec: docs/tasks/test-specs/NNN-name-test-spec.md
```

## Hook profiles

Hooks run automatically and are gated by profile level. Control via environment variables:

```bash
export CLAUDE_HOOK_PROFILE=minimal    # Safety hooks only (secret protection, block-no-verify, config-protection)
export CLAUDE_HOOK_PROFILE=standard   # + workflow hooks (plan restructuring, compaction, checkpoints) — default
export CLAUDE_HOOK_PROFILE=strict     # + formatting, notifications (batch-format-typecheck, desktop-notify)
export CLAUDE_DISABLED_HOOKS=desktop-notify,batch-format-typecheck  # Disable specific hooks
```

## Boundaries

### Always
- Write the test spec before any implementation code
- Commit and push after every milestone (task completed, spec written, ADR written)
- Read the task file and test spec before starting work on a task
- Create an ADR for significant design decisions

### Ask first
- Modifying files in `docs/` — they are planning documents, not implementation
- Deleting or renaming existing source files
- Adding dependencies not already in the tech stack
- Changing the project structure beyond what a task requires

### Never
- Create files in `src/` without a corresponding task and test spec
- Combine unrelated changes in one task or commit
- Skip the test spec — even for "small" changes
- Force push or rewrite published git history
- Add a `Co-Authored-By` line to commits unless explicitly asked

## Common rationalizations

These are excuses agents use to skip steps. Don't fall for them.

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "I'll commit after the next task too" | No. Commit now. Batched commits are impossible to untangle later. |
| "This task is too small for a test spec" | The spec defines done — without it you're guessing. Write one. |
| "I'll add tests later" | Later never comes. The test spec comes first, always. |
| "These two tasks are related, I'll do them together" | One task, one commit. If it feels too granular, the tasks are scoped correctly. |
| "The architecture doc doesn't need updating" | If you made a non-obvious design decision, write an ADR. |
| "I'll just quickly fix this other thing I noticed" | Stay on your task. Note it for later — don't scope-creep. |
